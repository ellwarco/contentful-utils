>  Command line tool to help you manage your Contentful spaces more efficiently.

### Examples

#### Copying fields

Often times when working on your content model, you might want to create a field on a content type that should be configured exactly like on another content type. It should have the same required, localization and validation configuration. Unfortunately, Contentful currently does not support copying fields between content types. Wouldn't it be super useful to have a *master* content type that contains pre-configured fields that you can just copy over to a new content type you're working on? Now you can.

```bash
> contentful-utils copy-fields slug title \
  --source blogPost \
  --target page \
  --config ~/Desktop/contentful-config.json
```

This will copy the fields `slug` and `title` from your content type `blogPost` to the content type `page`, using access credentials and other parameters stored inside `~/Desktop/contentful-config.json`.

#### Deleting fields

Deleting fields from a content type can be a bit tedious on Contentful. When doing this from the frontend, you have to first disable the field in the editor and in responses, save the content type, delete the field and save, again. This takes precious time, when during an exploratory phase you might not need to be this cautious. Now you can delete a field with just one command.

```bash
> contentful-utils copy-fields slug \
  --source blogPost \
  --target page \
  --config ~/Desktop/contentful-config.json
```

This will copy the field `slug` from your content type `blogPost` to the content type `page`, using access credentials and other parameters stored inside `~/Desktop/contentful-config.json`.

### Requirements

contentful-utils tracks NodeJS stable to benefit for the latest language features. However, currently Node.js `v.6.x.x` should be sufficient.

### Installation

Install globally using npm.

contentful-utils have a bunch of global options, for example the `space`, as well as command specific options. All configuration flags can also be provided in a `config.json` passed on to contentful-utils using the `â€”config` flag.
